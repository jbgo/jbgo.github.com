title: Why I'm quitting caffeine again
---

I was waking up in the middle of the night from caffeine withdrawals. I would actually sleep better if I consumed a cup of coffee before bed.

It makes my mind race, which makes me crazy! I'm more likely to be depressed and assume the worst in situations.

It makes my muscles tighter. I was having a lot of trouble with cramps. Getting rid of caffeine allows them to hurt.
