title: Why I'm quitting caffeine again
---

### Caffeine prevents me from sleeping

I was waking up in the middle of the night from caffeine withdrawals. I would actually sleep better if I consumed a cup of coffee before bed.

### Caffeine makes my mind race

It makes my mind race, which makes me crazy! I'm more likely to be depressed and assume the worst in situations.

### Caffeine increases tension in my body

It makes my muscles tighter. I was having a lot of trouble with cramps. Getting rid of caffeine allows them to hurt.

### Caffeine is a crutch

It makes you power through when what you really need is a break, or some sleep, or a career change.

### How I quit caffeine slowly

If you're a four cup a day person, like I was, you definitely don't want to quit cold turkey. It's too miserable of an experience - your head hurts all the time and you are too tired to move.

Instead you have to ween yourself off it.

If you're average is 4 cups, you can go down to 3 cups/day immediately if you time them right. The same for two, then for 1. After that you need to start going half and half, or even less than that. You can either grind some decaf and regular together, or you can take a little cold brew and mix it in to a cup of decaf. I really like this method, but be sure to measure because cold brew is typically has a higher concentration of caffeine than normal coffee, so it's easy to overdo it. Finally, you need to stay on the decaf for a week or so (it still has a very small amount of caffeine). Once your disgust for decaf has become stronger for your desire for a cup of coffee, you are officially detoxed. Stop drinking decaf now or you will be more susceptible to cravings for real coffee. The total proccess takes 3-4 weeks with the final week being entirely decaf. Also be careful about other sources of caffeine like iced tea, most soft drinks, and chocolate.
