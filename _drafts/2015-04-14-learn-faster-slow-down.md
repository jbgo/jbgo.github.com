title: Want to learn faster? slow down!
---

I've always considered myself a fast learner.  Yesterday, a friend of mine surprised me by telling me he thought of himself as a slow learner. We are coworkers with the same job function, software developer, and learning is vital to our success in this position.

As a software developer, you are always learning something new. You may be building something you've never built before and need to acquire domain expertise, or you are introducing a new, shiny, NoSQL database that you've never used before. So when you come across [sexy techniques to increase your learning speed](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2013/05/20/accelerated-learning-techniques/) you jump all over them. If you listen to the opening of that, I wouldn't call getting to the top 5% in 6-12 months speed learning. In fact, you'll probably spend the next 5-10 years getting into the top 1%. I'm not saying that those techniques don't work (maybe they are actually very good). For example, speed reading sounds like a great way to learn faster, but if you think you can read a freshman calculus textbook at 1,200 WPM and pass the exam afterwards (assuming you don't already know calculus) [you may be mistaken](http://lifehacker.com/the-truth-about-speed-reading-1542508398). I'm just saying that I've found the same few techniques, applied in healthy doses, consistently, over a long period of time add up to a huge ocean of knowledge. It's kind of like compound interest for your mind.



Enough talking. Here is the system I use to learn faster. There are six techniques, but they make up one system of learning. You will notice that seem very efficient, but they do result in knowledge and skills getting stuck in your head for long periods of time.

### Slow down!

Read and re-read. Look up the references and read those. Pause between paragraphs or when you reach a dense sentence. I

### Take a break

Your brain can only absorb so much information before it starts to fatigue. Know your limit and try not to exceed it. Give yourself some time to decompress and absorb what you learned. Your brain is still working for you subconsciously, so go enjoy life, or take a nap for a little while.

### Remember

Over the next hours, days, weeks, take the time to remember what you learned. Summarize the key points in your head while you're driving to work. Or take 5 minutes to write a summarize of something you learned last week after breakfast. Go for a walk and think about things that seemed surprising or remarkable to you.

### Apply

Build a prototype. Use it in a side project. Leverage a new technique to boost your productivity at work.

### Share

Share your knowledge by writing a blog post about it. Favor being concise over being long winded. If the post gets long, make it a series and keep each post concise. Put your prototype code on github. Share your blog post with friends.

### Repeat

Repeat. Be consistent. Practice. You will improve, it may seem slow. If you feel like you've hit a learning plateau, keep pressing on. Often your are only weeks or days away from exponential growth. Real learning looks more like the chart on the right than the chart on the left.
