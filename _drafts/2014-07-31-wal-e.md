title: Getting started with wal-e
---

## Quick Start

1. How to install wal-e (the easy way)
2. How to configure wal-e (via environment variables)
3. How to configure wal-e (via daemontools)
4. How to configure your postgres master
5. How to test your wal-e commands (listing backups, taking a full backup)

## How to configure

6. What settings matter and why? (this is where I got in trouble, I was losing WAL segments - and still am!)

For some variations on the theme, also check out these posts:

## Restoring with wal-e

If you can't do this, wal-e is pointless.

## My problem - missing wall segmengs

I could upload them manually once I was keeping enough wal segments:

```
postgres@powersites-postgres:~$ wal-e wal-push /var/lib/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_xlog/000000010000004D00000030
```

But why should I have to do this at all? What if I'm not able to get to the server in time to manually upload
these segments before



# install wal-e
sudo apt-get install lzop pv python-pip python-dev python-lxml daemontools
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install wal-e

# Make the wall env directory
umask u=rwx,g=rx,o=
sudo mkdir -p /etc/wal-e.d/env
echo '<your access key id>' | sudo tee -a /etc/wal-e.d/env/AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
echo '<your secret access key>' | sudo tee -a /etc/wal-e.d/env/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
echo 's3://autorevo_backups/powersites_sql/' | sudo tee -a /etc/wal-e.d/env/WALE_S3_PREFIX
sudo chown -R root:postgres /etc/wal-e.d

# command for troubleshooting in case postgres doesn't come back up
/usr/lib/postgresql/9.3/bin/postgres -D /var/lib/postgresql/9.3/main -c config_file=/etc/postgresql/9.3/main/postgresql.conf

# change to postgres user to interact with wal-e
sudo su - postgres

# show all backups
envdir /etc/wal-e.d/env wal-e backup-list --detail

# restore from latest backup
service postgresql stop
# downloads the latest backup
envdir /etc/wal-e.d/env wal-e backup-fetch /var/lib/postgresql/9.3/main LATEST

# gets up to date by downloading latest wal segments
cat > /var/lib/postgresql/9.3/main/recovery.conf
standby_mode     = 'on'
restore_command  = '/usr/bin/envdir /etc/wal-e.d/env wal-e wal-fetch "%f" "%p"'
trigger_file     = '/data/postgresql/9.1/main/trigger'
^D

service postgresql start
# now wait wail wal-e restores all the WAL segments
