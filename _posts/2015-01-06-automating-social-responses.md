title: Automating social responses
---

Yesterday I posted [my elevator pitch]({% post_url 2015-01-05-elevator-pitch %}).
I called it my new elevetor pitch because that sounded good
to me, but in reality, I've never had an elevator pitch. That got me thinking about other situations
where having some canned responses to common questions, like "what do you do?" or "how are you?"

The truth is, I am not very good with social responses. I may not smile when I see you, or I may
give you a strange reply to some bit of small talk. For example, someone might ask me "Can you
believe this crazy weather?" and I might reply, "What weather? Oh." Or maybe I just won't even
respond. Or maybe you say something that makes me feel uncomfortable, so I just turn around and
leave the room.

The problem with this is not that I'm trying to be rude - the problem is that I am so spaced out
thinking about some problem and am not present in the moment. I am ignoring you and not giving
you the attention you deserve. When I am not ignoring you, I often don't know how to respond to
you because I never learned how to simply talk to someone. I'm discovering that small talk and friendly
chitchat, while seemingly unimportant to someone like me who likes solving challenging problems,
serves the important social function of creating meaningful connections between people.

My plan for improving involves brainstorming canned responses for smalltalk questions
and then using those responses in real conversations before work, after church, in the line at the grocery store,
or wherever they happen. For example, my typical response to "Did you watch the game last night?"
would be something like "What game?" But instead, I could reply with, "No, I missed it. What was
the final score?" This response not only shows that I listened to you and would like a response in return, but
also elicits a response that gives me some clue of what you're talking about so I can continue the
conversation in an intelligent manner if I choose.

Another situation I could improve is when I need to exit a conversation quickly and gracefully.
Perhaps I have a meeting or am just in a hurry to get to the men's room. Usually I just walk
away without saying anything or am stuck listening to a person ramble on and on about something
(I am surprised when these people can't read my body language that says wrap it up I have to be
somewhere else). I realize a graceful exit may not always be possible, but interrupting and saying
something like "Hey, sorry to interrupt, but I'm late for a meeting with my boss. Let's talk more
later," would be a much better response than saying nothing at all. It's much less insulting at least.

If all of this sounds really weird to you, then you probably don't need it. Go read something else.
But if you're still reading this, it means you, like me, did not learn proper social skills growing
up and find yourself, as an adult, fumbling around in an increasingly social world.

Anyways, enough rambling (detecting and short circuiting rambling is another good conversational
skill to learn). Here is my process for improving my social skills by automating social responses.

- Remember an awkward conversation you had today.
- Write down at least three ways you could have responded differently that could have resulted in
  a better conversation.
- When you have similar conversations, use one of your new responses.
- Continually refine your new responses based on whether or not they resulted in better conversations.

That's it. This is not a process you can finish. You probably do this naturally in your ahead most
of the time. Some people are naturally better at this than others and having a defined process can
help those of us who are not social butterflies.

Also, don't get the wrong impression about me - I am great at having deep, meaningful conversations
and very focused, technical conversations. I struggle with first impressions and general friendliness.
